\section{Projects}

\runsubsection{uthread}
\descript{ | C++ fiber/user-space threading library }
\begin{tightemize}
\item Uses cooperative scheduling with fast context switching (30M+ thread context switches/second on a single x86-64 core)
\item Provides primitives for synchronizing between fibers via mutexes, condition variables, etc.
\item Provides a non-blocking IO API for timers, sockets, etc. via libevent
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{PathTracer}
\descript{ | C++ Rendering Engine }
\begin{tightemize}
\item A physically accurate rendering engine with support for Monte Carlo global illumination, fresnel reflections/refractions, and texture mapping that probabilistically approximates the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation}{rendering equation}.
\item Uses \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy}{Bounding Volume Hierarchies} for improved ray-intersection performance and a worker-thread architecture for parallelizing chunk rendering.

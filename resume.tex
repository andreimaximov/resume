\section{Experience}

\runsubsection{Facebook}
\descript{ | Software Engineering Intern }
\location{September 2017 – December 2017 | Search Ranking Infra | Menlo Park, CA}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a C++ stream processing platform for efficiently approximating top-K elements in a sliding window of millions of unique candidates.
\item Released it to Facebook engineers as a generic, easy to use, config-driven, and fully-managed service.
\item Deployed it to production and enabled realtime updates for use cases such as top clicked search results.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Quora}
\descript{ | Software Engineering Intern }
\location{June 2017 – September 2017 | Infra/Data Platform | Mountain View, CA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a system for monitoring realtime and historic infrastructure metrics using Scala, Apache Spark, and Kafka to improve reliability and scalability compared to existing systems.
\item Improved disaster mitigation utilities with MySQL query blacklisting using Python and ZooKeeper.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Google}
\descript{ | Software Engineering Intern }
\location{June 2016 – September 2016 | Chrome Apps | Mountain View, CA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed an ORM abstraction for integrating the Apps Admin SDK as a datastore into App Maker, a GUI based app builder for enterprise customers.
\item Wrote a Java + JavaScript based query engine on top of the Admin SDK to allow for filtering and entity relationships with other datastore backends.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{eFolder}
\descript{ | Software Developer Intern }
\location{June 2014 – May 2016 | Mountain View, CA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a prototype for a realtime graph-based Lambda Architecture metrics system using Java, Hadoop MapReduce for batch computation, and AWS Lambda + Kinesis for stream processing/realtime updates.
\item Implemented an automated billing system using PHP and PostgreSQL responsible for processing a majority of eFolder's revenue.

\section{Projects}

\runsubsection{PathTracer}
\descript{ | C++ Rendering Engine }
\begin{tightemize}
\item A physically accurate rendering engine with support for Monte Carlo global illumination, fresnel reflections/refractions, and texture mapping that probabilistically approximates the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation}{rendering equation}.
\item Uses \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume_hierarchy}{Bounding Volume Hierarchies} for improved ray-intersection performance and a worker-thread architecture for parallelizing chunk rendering.
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{uthread}
\descript{ | C++ fiber/user-space threading library }
\begin{tightemize}
\item Uses cooperative scheduling with fast context switching (30M+ thread context switches/second on a single x86-64 core)
\item Provides user-space synchronization via mutexes, condition variables, etc.
\item Provides a non-blocking IO API for timers, sockets, etc. via libevent
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{usrnet}
\descript{ | Rust user-space network stack }
\begin{tightemize}
\item Provides a rich callback-based API of raw ethernet, IP, UDP, and TCP sockets similar to that of libevent.
\item Includes arping, ping, traceroute, netcat, and echo server examples.
\item Exchanges raw ethernet frames via a Linux TAP using the OS kernel as a router.
\item TCP sockets are in progress, currently support connection establishment.
